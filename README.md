# A-Maze-Ing Dice Game (Working Name)

## Overview
School project to practice __Python__ and __Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)__<br>
Text based adventure game, that takes place in a dungeon maze. The player walks around the dark maze to find the exit, and encounters enemies and other items along the way.<br>
The battle situations are settled with dices, that are painted with attack points or defend points instead of numbers (My plan is to add a deck-building type of feature for the dices at a later stage). 
They maze is procedurally each round, and will look differnet every time.

## Dependencies
